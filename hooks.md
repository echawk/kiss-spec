The -update hooks start in the current repository. In other words, you can
operate on the repository directly or grab the value from '\$PWD'.

The second argument of pre-update is '0' if the current user owns the
repository and '1' if they do not. In the latter case, privilege
escalation is required to preserve ownership.
